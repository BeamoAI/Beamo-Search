# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report any security vulnerabilities in the repository to the email `beamo@beamosupport.com` with all the necessary details and everything you know about it so that we can patch it privately and securely together.

You should receive an update within 2 days on whether or not we are looking into it as well as an update once the vulnerablity has been fixed and pushed to the main repository.

Just remember that all vulnerabilities that are reported will be looked into and are all greatly appreciated. Thank you so much again!
